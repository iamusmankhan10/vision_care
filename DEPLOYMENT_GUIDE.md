## üìÅ Build Files Location
Your optimized production files are located in:
```

```

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Hostinger Deployment

### Step 1: Hostinger Account Setup
1. **Sign up/Login** to [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com)
2. **Choose a hosting plan** (Premium or Business recommended for React apps)
3. **Select or register a domain** (e.g., youreyewearstore.com)

### Step 2: Access File Manager
1. Login to **Hostinger Control Panel**
2. Go to **Files** ‚Üí **File Manager**
3. Navigate to **public_html** folder (this is your website root)

### Step 3: Upload Your Website Files
1. **Delete default files** in public_html (index.html, etc.)
2. **Upload all contents** from your `build` folder to `public_html`:
   - index.html
   - static/ folder (contains CSS, JS, media files)
   - All other files from the build directory

**Important:** Upload the CONTENTS of the build folder, not the build folder itself.

### Step 4: Configure .htaccess for React Router
Create a `.htaccess` file in public_html with this content:

```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QR,L]

# Enable compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</IfModule>

# Set cache headers
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/webp "access plus 1 year"
</IfModule>
```

### Step 5: SSL Certificate Setup
1. In Hostinger Control Panel, go to **Security** ‚Üí **SSL**
2. **Enable SSL** for your domain (usually free with Hostinger)
3. **Force HTTPS** redirect

### Step 6: Domain Configuration
1. If using a custom domain, update **DNS settings** in your domain registrar
2. Point **A record** to Hostinger's IP address
3. Wait for **DNS propagation** (up to 24 hours)

## üîß File Upload Methods

### Method 1: File Manager (Recommended)
- Use Hostinger's built-in File Manager

If you prefer FTP, use these settings:
- **Host:** Your domain or server IP
