# 🔧 Netlify Build Failure Fix

## 🚨 Problem: Dependency Installation Failed

The build is failing because Netlify can't install the dependencies properly. This is a common issue with React projects.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Update netlify.toml with Build Fix
I'll update your netlify.toml with proper build configuration.

### Step 2: Clear Netlify Cache
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. **Site settings** → **Build & deploy** → **Environment variables**
3. Add this variable to force cache clear:
   - **Key**: `NETLIFY_CACHE_CLEAR`
   - **Value**: `true`

### Step 3: Trigger Fresh Build
1. Go to **Deploys** tab in Netlify
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Clear cache and deploy site**

### Step 4: Alternative - Manual Build Commands
If the above doesn't work, try these build commands in Netlify:

**Build command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
**Publish directory**: `build`
