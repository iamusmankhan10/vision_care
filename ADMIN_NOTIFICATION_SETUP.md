### Step 2: Configure Firebase

  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

2. Update the VAPID key in the same file:
```javascript
vapidKey: 'your-vapid-key-from-firebase-console'
```

3. Place your service account key file in `server/firebase-service-account-key.json`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

4. **Network Issues**: Check if localhost:5002 is accessible

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test notification server health
curl http://localhost:5002/health

# Test notification sending
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/admin/test-notification \

```

**Issue**: "No admin tokens registered"
**Solution**: Open admin dashboard and click "Enable Notifications"

**Issue**: Notifications work in browser but not on mobile
**Solution**: Install the PWA app on your phone and enable notifications in the app

**Issue**: Firebase errors
**Solution**: Verify your Firebase config and service account key are correct

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"

PORT=5002
```

### Deploy to Cloud:
1. Deploy notification server to Heroku/Railway/Vercel
2. Update notification URLs in frontend to use production server
