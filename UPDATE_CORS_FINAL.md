# ðŸ”— Final Integration Step: Update CORS with Netlify URL

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Get Your Netlify URL
After deploying to Netlify, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- `https://amazing-project-123.netlify.app`

### Step 2: Update CORS Configuration
In `server/productServer.js`, replace this line:
```javascript
'https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app', // Replace with your actual Netlify URL when you get it
```

With your actual Netlify URL:
```javascript
'https://your-actual-netlify-url.netlify.app', // Your real Netlify URL
```

### Step 3: Push Changes to Railway
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Netlify URL to CORS configuration"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger a Railway redeploy with the updated CORS settings.
