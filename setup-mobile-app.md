# Quick Mobile App Setup

Follow these steps to get your mobile admin app working:

## Step 1: Start the Simple Push Server

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Start the simple push server (no additional dependencies needed)
node simplePushServer.js
```

You should see:
```
ðŸ”” Simple Push Notification Server running on port 5004
ðŸ“± Mode: Mock/Testing (install web-push for real notifications)
```

## Step 2: Test the Server

Open your browser and go to:
- `http://localhost:5004/api/health` - Should show server status
- `http://localhost:5004/api/setup-instructions` - Shows upgrade instructions

## Step 3: Access Mobile Test Page

On your phone or computer, go to:
`http://localhost:3000/admin/mobile/test`

Test each feature:
1. âœ… Test Notification Permission
2. âœ… Test Service Worker  
3. âœ… Test Push Server
4. âœ… Send Test Notification

## Step 4: Access Full Mobile App

Once tests pass, go to:
`http://localhost:3000/admin/mobile`

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Error sending test notification":

1. **Check if server is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5004/api/health
   ```

2. **Check server logs** - Look for error messages in the terminal

3. **Try the simple server first:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node simplePushServer.js
   ```

4. **Check network connectivity:**
   - Make sure both React app (port 3000) and push server (port 5004) are running
   - Check firewall settings

### Common Issues:

- **CORS errors**: The simple server includes CORS headers
- **Port conflicts**: Change PORT in the server file if needed
- **Network issues**: Make sure you're accessing the correct IP address

## Upgrade to Real Push Notifications

Once the mock version works, upgrade to real notifications:

```bash
cd server
npm install web-push
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

Then update `pushNotificationServer.js` with your VAPID keys and use that instead.

## Success Indicators

âœ… Server health check returns status "ok"  
âœ… Test notification shows success message  
âœ… Mobile app loads without errors  
âœ… Stats display correctly  
âœ… Recent orders show up  

## Next Steps

1. Install the mobile app as PWA on your phone
2. Enable notifications when prompted
3. Test with real orders
4. Upgrade to real push notifications when ready
